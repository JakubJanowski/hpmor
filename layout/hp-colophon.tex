\leftskip=0pt\rightskip=0pt\parfillskip=0pt plus 1fil{}This book was created thanks to the efforts of fans of the story. Final formatting and production were completed by Jakub Janowski. The text was set in Huerta Tipografica's Alegreya type family. Chapter headings were set in Lumos, inspired by the display font used in the US editions of the Harry Potter books, drawn by Sarah McFalls. The book was typeset with \LaTeX, and the cover artwork was created with the GIMP. Book PDF files were built on \today\ from source version \mbox{\gitFirstTagDescribe}. The source code can be found at: \mbox{\url{https://github.com/JakubJanowski/hpmor}} If you find any errors, please open an issue there.
